        "brief_summary": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute multi-system vasculitis syndrome of unknown etiology occurring mostly in infants and children younger than 5 years of age. In developed countries, it is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children. However, KD remains a mysterious disease.~Single high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2gm/kg) and aspirin are standard treatment for KD. Aspirin have been prescribed in treatment of KD for decade even earlier than usage of IVIG. High dose aspirin mainly act as anti-inflammation, while low dose aspirin as anti-platelet. IVIG may play most of the role of anti-inflammation in acute stage of KD. Hsieh et al. reported that KD without high dose aspirin had the same treatment response after IVIG. Therefore it is still unclear about the necessarily of high dose aspirin in acute stage of KD.~This study was conduct to investigate the role of high dose aspirin in acute stage of KD via a multi-center randomized control trail, and we plan to achieve the followings till year 2017:~Enroll 300 KD patients from multiple medical centers . Randomize group patients as group 1: with high dose aspirin (more than 30/mg/kd/day) until fever subsided and shift to low dose aspirin (3-5mg/kg/day, N=150); and group 2: without high dose aspirin during acute febrile stage, only use low dose aspirin (N=150).~Compare data including fever days, admission duration, laboratory data (CBC/DC, GOT/GPT, BUN/Cr, Alb, ESR, CRP, 2D echo), IVIG treatment response and CAL formation rate (followed at least 1 year)."

        "brief_summary": "Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Incidence of late coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, which may lead to myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, or ischemic heart disease, decreased after the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. However, significant persistent coronary arterial lesions or aneurysms may still occur in about 1-3 % of the patients.~Atorvastatin (Lipitor\u00ae), a kind of statin, is a selective competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This drug had been safely and widely used for treatment of adult hyperlipidemia, prevention of coronary heart disease and familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood. In addition to the cholesterol-lowering effects, statins exerts diverse cellular, cholesterol-independent effects, including improvement in endothelial function, inhibition of neurohormonal activation, and reduction in levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Based on the above concepts, some patients with infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms received statin therapies and then the growth rate of aneurysms slowed down.~Therefore, the investigators may hypothesize that Atorvastatin is helpful in the regression of persistent coronary lesions in KD patients due to its effect of anti-inflammation. In NTUH, there are about 20 KD patients with coronary lesions persistent for many years. And the investigators plan to conduct the clinical trial with atorvastatin to evaluate the effects of Atorvastatin on the persistent coronary arterial lesions/aneurysms in children with Kawasaki disease including safety and efficacy.~Methods~There are around 20 KD patients eligible for this study. After they sign the IRB-approved ICF, they will be enrolled for this study. Briefly, this study is divided into three stages: screening & enrollment stage (I), treatment & follow-up stage (II) for 1 year and final data analysis stage (III). Measurements include basic vital sign, electrocardiography, liver function, muscle enzyme, inflammatory markers and echocardiography.~Predicted results~1.Oral atorvastatin therapy can effectively prevent the progression of coronary lesions in KD patients."

        "brief_summary": "Suriname is a small developing country in South America with a population of half a million people. Early neonatal death in Suriname is high with 16 per 1000 live births. Unpublished data from the Suriname Perinatal and Infant Mortality Survey estimate contribution of infection to early neonatal mortality at 25% (4 per 1000 live births) of all deaths. In comparison, incidence rates of neonatal sepsis alone are 3.5 per 1000 live births. These numbers indicate an increased burden of neonatal infection in Suriname versus the U.S. In any case about 40 newborns that die each year of infection are a huge loss, also considering the small Surinamese community. Despite this overall idea on the impact of infectious disease in Surinamese neonates exact information regarding incidence, type of infection (e.g., localized, viral, early-onset or late-onset sepsis), risk factors (e.g., insufficient antenatal care, maternal Group B-Streptococcus status), etiology, microbial causes, morbidity, antibiotic treatment (type and duration), and epidemiological determinants (e.g., gestational age, sex, ethnicity) are lacking.~From a clinical perspective, there is still a challenge to identify neonates with infection. Neonates are often admitted with ambivalent clinical symptoms and receive preventive antibiotics that are costly, promote pathogen-resistance, and have negative long-term effects (i.e., on the development of the intestinal bacterial flora). Currently, assessment of blood leukocyte or trombocyte counts and levels of CRP are insufficiently sensitive to be used as biomarkers, while confirmation of actual sepsis or meningitis by positive culture results is relatively rare (0.5-3% in the United States). This complicates decisions on duration of antibiotic treatment and hospitalization significantly, while no other biomarkers exist.~The circulating isoforms of adhesion molecules (cAMs), which mediate interactions of leukocytes with the vascular endothelium, have been proposed as biomarkers for infection and sepsis. During infection they accumulate in the bloodstream as a result of shedding, which represents their removal from cell surfaces of endothelial cells and leukocytes by enzymes called sheddases. Recently, we have reviewed mechanisms behind shedding of cAMs in neonatal, pediatric and adult sepsis. The shedding process reflects a critical and active process in orchestrating interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium for an effective host response, while minimizing collateral tissue damage. As a result, both plasma levels of cAMs and their sheddases are subject to change during infection and sepsis. Additionally, compelling, albeit limited, data suggest changes of levels of cAMs in CSF in adult and pediatric meningitis.~To date, some evidence exists of changes in levels of cAMs during malaria (in children from Malawi) and sepsis, although not sensitive enough to predict outcomes in the clinic. Those levels have never been assessed simultaneously with levels of their sheddases in blood or CSF as a diagnostic tool. We propose that this combined approach may provide more detailed information about the extent of inflammatory activation in neonates.While a balance in levels is maintained under resting conditions or mild (local) infection, it may be perturbed during sepsis or meningitis . Thus, simultaneous measurement of these levels could promote early identification of infection, and may even distinguish between mild infection, systemic infection or meningitis. Currently, manufacturers are rapidly developing Luminex\u00ae technology as an advanced, fast, high-throughput and clinically feasible bedside tool for such an approach.~We hypothesize that incidence rates of neonates with infection in Suriname are high. We further hypothesize that, upon signs of infection, the simultaneous measurement of cAMs and their SEs in serum and CSF discriminates between infected and non-infected neonates. We aim to: 1) identify and follow neonates at the Academic Hospital Paramaribo with signs of infection to establish incidence rates of infection, and 2) investigate diagnostic potential of our proposed biomarker combination in these neonates for infection, type of infection (e.g., local (mild), sepsis or meningitis) and outcomes."
