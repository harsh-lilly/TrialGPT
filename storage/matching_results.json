Correction of suspected drug induced QTcF prolongation can be attempted at the investigator's discretion and only if clinically safe to do so with either discontinuation of the offending drug or switch to another drug not known to be associated with QTcF prolongation. Correction for underlying bundle branch block (BBB) allowed. Note: Patients with pacemakers are eligible if they have no history of fainting or clinically relevant arrhythmias while using the pacemaker",

Patients with positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and negative HBsAg require a negative hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evaluation before randomization. Patients who are HBV DNA PCR positive will be excluded. Patients who are HBV DNA PCR negative with positive anti-HBc require prophylaxis against Hepatitis B reactivation (see Section 6.4 \"General Guidance for Hepatic Monitoring\").",
                "12. Hepatitis C virus (HCV): positive hepatitis C antibody. If positive hepatitis C antibody result, patient will need to have a negative result for hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) before randomization. Patients who are hepatitis C RNA positive will be excluded.",

                "17. Pregnant or nursing (breast-feeding) women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk to using pirtobrutinib in pregnant or nursing women. Patients are excluded if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the study or within 1 year of the last dose of study treatment. Patients are also excluded if they are lactating or plan to breastfeed during the study or within 1 week of the last dose of study treatment. Please see Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 for General Guidance for Women of Child Bearing Potential and/or Use of Contraceptive Methods.",
                "18. Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgement, interfere with full participation in the study, including administration of pirtobrutinib and attending required study visits (if outpatient); pose a significant risk to the participant; or interfere with interpretation of study data.",
                "19. Inability of the participant to swallow and retain oral medication. Or, if there is clinically significant active malabsorption syndrome or other condition likely to affect gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of the study drug.",

NOTE: Major bleeding is defined as bleeding having one or more of the following features: potentially life-threatening bleeding with signs or symptoms of hemodynamic compromise; bleeding associated with a decrease in the hemoglobin level of at least 2g per deciliter; or bleeding in a critical area or organ (e.g., retroperitoneal, intraarticular, pericardial, epidural, or intracranial bleeding or intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome)",
